# Characterizing the Performance Bottleneck in Neuroimaging Pipelines
This project is a first phase in attempting to reduce computation cost of neuroimaging pipelines.

# About
We profile the popular pre-processing pipelines: [fMRIPrep](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep) and [DIPY](https://github.com/dipy/dipy). Moreover, at a finer level, we explore the different pipelines composing fMRIPrep and Dipy.
