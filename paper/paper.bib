  title    = {Symmetric diffeomorphic image registration with
              cross-correlation: evaluating automated labeling of elderly and

  abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is
              detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying
              spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important
              component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid
              in discriminating between related diseases, such as
              frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which
              manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we
              develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for
              maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of
              diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations
              necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful
              evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard,
              human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a
              related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation
              of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably
              with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the
              template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the
              correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings
              of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual
              rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested,
              SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with
              volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study
              indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method
              for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric
              MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

  abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open
              source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs (
              http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the
              segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization
              (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based
              on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos
              is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps
              (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF)
              modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle
              large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
              section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory
              footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation
              aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different
              ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from
              Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue
              segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use
              of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by
              prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3)
              Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
              maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos
              performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM
              segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from
              University College London. These evaluation studies, combined
              with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options,
              demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new
              platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in data augmentation and transfer learning,
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) difficultly generalise to
              unseen domains. When segmenting brain scans, CNNs are highly
              sensitive to changes in resolution and contrast: even within the
              same MRI modality, performance can decrease across datasets. Here
              we introduce SynthSeg, the first segmentation CNN robust against
              changes in contrast and resolution. SynthSeg is trained with
              synthetic data sampled from a generative model conditioned on
              segmentations. Crucially, we adopt a domain randomisation
              strategy where we fully randomise the contrast and resolution of
              the synthetic training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can segment
              real scans from a wide range of target domains without retraining
              or fine-tuning, which enables straightforward analysis of huge
              amounts of heterogeneous clinical data. Because SynthSeg only
              requires segmentations to be trained (no images), it can learn
              from labels obtained by automated methods on diverse populations
              (e.g., ageing and diseased), thus achieving robustness to a wide
              range of morphological variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on
              5,000 scans of six modalities (including CT) and ten resolutions,
              where it exhibits unparallelled generalisation compared with
              supervised CNNs, state-of-the-art domain adaptation, and Bayesian
              segmentation. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of
              SynthSeg by applying it to cardiac MRI and CT scans.},

              However, the high energy demand cannot be fully explained by
              brain size scaling alone. We hypothesized that energy-demanding
              signaling strategies may have contributed to human cognitive
              development. We measured the energy distribution along signaling
              pathways using multimodal brain imaging and found that
              evolutionarily novel connections have up to 67\% higher energetic
              costs of signaling than sensory-motor pathways. Additionally,
              histology, transcriptomic data, and molecular imaging
              independently reveal an upregulation of signaling at G-protein
              coupled receptors in energy-demanding regions. We found that
              neuromodulators are predominantly involved in complex cognition
              such as reading or memory processing. Our study suggests that the
              upregulation of neuromodulator activity, alongside increased

              is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of

              represent an enormous challenge to the successful integration of
              information from different images for both within- and
              between-subject analysis. While many algorithms to register image
              pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that

              there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the

              Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that
              it treats the two images very differently. The reference image
              must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces

              the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue

              their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI

              normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to
              even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at
              aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in
              which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in

  abstract = {We introduce a strategy for learning image registration without
              acquired imaging data, producing powerful networks agnostic to
              contrast introduced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While
              classical registration methods accurately estimate the spatial
              correspondence between images, they solve an optimization problem
              for every new image pair. Learning-based techniques are fast at
              test time but limited to registering images with contrasts and
              geometric content similar to those seen during training. We
              propose to remove this dependency on training data by leveraging
              a generative strategy for diverse synthetic label maps and images
              that exposes networks to a wide range of variability, forcing
              them to learn more invariant features. This approach results in
              powerful networks that accurately generalize to a broad array of
              MRI contrasts. We present extensive experiments with a focus on
              3D neuroimaging, showing that this strategy enables robust and
              accurate registration of arbitrary MRI contrasts even if the
              target contrast is not seen by the networks during training. We
              demonstrate registration accuracy surpassing the state of the art
              both within and across contrasts, using a single model.
              Critically, training on arbitrary shapes synthesized from noise
              distributions results in competitive performance, removing the
              dependency on acquired data of any kind. Additionally, since
              anatomical label maps are often available for the anatomy of
              interest, we show that synthesizing images from these
              dramatically boosts performance, while still avoiding the need

  abstract = {The removal of non-brain signal from magnetic resonance imaging
              (MRI) data, known as skull-stripping, is an integral component of
              many neuroimage analysis streams. Despite their abundance,
              popular classical skull-stripping methods are usually tailored to
              images with specific acquisition properties, namely
              near-isotropic resolution and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI contrast,
              which are prevalent in research settings. As a result, existing
              tools tend to adapt poorly to other image types, such as stacks
              of thick slices acquired with fast spin-echo (FSE) MRI that are
              common in the clinic. While learning-based approaches for brain
              extraction have gained traction in recent years, these methods
              face a similar burden, as they are only effective for image types
              seen during the training procedure. To achieve robust
              skull-stripping across a landscape of imaging protocols, we
              introduce SynthStrip, a rapid, learning-based brain-extraction
              tool. By leveraging anatomical segmentations to generate an
              entirely synthetic training dataset with anatomies, intensity
              distributions, and artifacts that far exceed the realistic range
              of medical images, SynthStrip learns to successfully generalize
              to a variety of real acquired brain images, removing the need for
              training data with target contrasts. We demonstrate the efficacy
              of SynthStrip for a diverse set of image acquisitions and
              resolutions across subject populations, ranging from newborn to
              adult. We show substantial improvements in accuracy over popular
              skull-stripping baselines - all with a single trained model. Our
              method and labeled evaluation data are available at
              https://w3id.org/synthstrip.},

  title    = {A global optimisation method for robust affine registration of
              brain images},
  author   = {Jenkinson, M and Smith, S},
  abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis
              and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have
              fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic
              registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all
              share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost
              function. To date little attention has been focused on the
              optimisation method itself, even though the success of most
              registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation.
              This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of
              registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity
              measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation
              methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is
              not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address
              this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is
              specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full
              discussion of all the necessary implementation details is
              included as this is an important part of any practical method.
              Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject
              registration experiments that show that the proposed method is
              more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the
              currently available registration packages in common usage.},

  abstract      = {The state-of-the-art hardware platforms for training Deep
                   Neural Networks (DNNs) are moving from traditional single
                   precision (32-bit) computations towards 16 bits of precision
                   -- in large part due to the high energy efficiency and
                   smaller bit storage associated with using reduced-precision
                   representations. However, unlike inference, training with
                   numbers represented with less than 16 bits has been
                   challenging due to the need to maintain fidelity of the
                   gradient computations during back-propagation. Here we
                   demonstrate, for the first time, the successful training of
                   DNNs using 8-bit floating point numbers while fully
                   maintaining the accuracy on a spectrum of Deep Learning
                   models and datasets. In addition to reducing the data and
                   computation precision to 8 bits, we also successfully reduce
                   the arithmetic precision for additions (used in partial
                   product accumulation and weight updates) from 32 bits to 16
                   bits through the introduction of a number of key ideas
                   including chunk-based accumulation and floating point
                   stochastic rounding. The use of these novel techniques lays
                   the foundation for a new generation of hardware training
                   platforms with the potential for 2-4x improved throughput
                   over today's systems.},

@article{Zhang2001-hx,
  title    = {Segmentation of brain {MR} images through a hidden Markov random
              field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm},
  author   = {Zhang, Y and Brady, M and Smith, S},
  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
              statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
              because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise
              constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a
              histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no
              spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM
              model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of
              noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to
              artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field
              distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
              produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
              hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic
              process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be
              observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through
              observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model
              is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the
              HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information
              is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites.
              Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation
              by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using
              MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the
              HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by
              incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a
              HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be
              achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be
              combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the
              bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997)
              can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a
              three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image
              segmentation.},

  abstract  = {Voxel volumes are simple to implement and lend themselves to
               many of the tools and algorithms available for 2D images.
               However, the additional dimension of voxels may be costly to
               manage in memory when mapping large spaces at high resolutions.
               While lowering the resolution and using interpolation is common
               work-around, in the literature we often find that authors either
               use trilinear interpolation or nearest neighbors and rarely any
               of the intermediate options. This paper presents a survey of
               geometric interpolation methods for voxel-based map
               representations. In particular we study the truncated signed
               distance field (TSDF) and the impact of using fewer than 8
               samples to perform interpolation within a depth-camera pose
               tracking and mapping scenario. We find that lowering the number
               of samples fetched to perform the interpolation results in
               performance similar to the commonly used trilinear interpolation
               method, but leads to higher frame-rates. We also report that
               lower bit-depth generally leads to performance degradation,
               though not as much as may be expected, with voxels containing as
               few as 3 bits sometimes resulting in adequate estimation of
               camera trajectories.},
