@ARTICLE{Cox1996-sl,
  title    = "{AFNI: software for analysis and visualization of functional
              magnetic resonance neuroimages}",
  author   = "Cox, R W",
  abstract = "A package of computer programs for analysis and visualization of
              three-dimensional human brain functional magnetic resonance
              imaging (FMRI) results is described. The software can color
              overlay neural activation maps onto higher resolution anatomical
              scans. Slices in each cardinal plane can be viewed
              simultaneously. Manual placement of markers on anatomical
              landmarks allows transformation of anatomical and functional
              scans into stereotaxic (Talairach-Tournoux) coordinates. The
              techniques for automatically generating transformed functional
              data sets from manually labeled anatomical data sets are
              described. Facilities are provided for several types of
              statistical analyses of multiple 3D functional data sets. The
              programs are written in ANSI C and Motif 1.2 to run on Unix
              workstations.",

              existing literature. We hope that some of this content might be
              of interest to users of FSL, and also maybe to new research
              groups considering creating, releasing and supporting new
              software packages for brain image analysis.",
