  abstract = "A package of computer programs for analysis and visualization of
              three-dimensional human brain functional magnetic resonance
              imaging (FMRI) results is described. The software can color
              overlay neural activation maps onto higher resolution anatomical
              scans. Slices in each cardinal plane can be viewed
              simultaneously. Manual placement of markers on anatomical
              landmarks allows transformation of anatomical and functional
              scans into stereotaxic (Talairach-Tournoux) coordinates. The
              techniques for automatically generating transformed functional
              data sets from manually labeled anatomical data sets are
              described. Facilities are provided for several types of
              statistical analyses of multiple 3D functional data sets. The
              programs are written in ANSI C and Motif 1.2 to run on Unix

              biomarkers are limited by the ability to reliably characterize
              inter-individual differences in human brain function. Although a
              growing number of connectomics-based measures are reported to
              have moderate to high test-retest reliability, the variability in
              data acquisition, experimental designs, and analytic methods
              precludes the ability to generalize results. The Consortium for
              Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) is working to address this

              standard for methods development in functional connectomics.
              Specifically, CoRR has aggregated 1,629 typical individuals'
              resting state fMRI (rfMRI) data (5,093 rfMRI scans) from 18
              international sites, and is openly sharing them via the

  abstract = "Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source
              software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic
              resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of
              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed
              by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
              contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in
              five countries and three continents, which is still growing.",

  abstract = "Preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              involves numerous steps to clean and standardize the data before
              statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc
              preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large
              inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows
              has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing.
              We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses
              the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI
              data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to
              the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring
              high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By
              introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative
              integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep
              robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data
              collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled
              spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing
              tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and
              transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure the
              validity of inference and the interpretability of results.",
