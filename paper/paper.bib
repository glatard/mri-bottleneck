  abstract  = "Exact timing is essential for functional MRI data analysis.
               Datasets are commonly measured using repeated 2D imaging
               methods, resulting in a temporal offset between slices. To
               compensate for this timing difference, slice-timing correction
               (i.e. temporal data interpolation) has been used as an fMRI
               pre-processing step for more than fifteen years. However, there
               has been an ongoing debate about the effectiveness and
               applicability of this method. This paper presents the first
               elaborated analysis of the impact of the slice-timing effect on
               simulated data for different fMRI paradigms and measurement
               parameters, taking into account data noise and smoothing
               effects. Here we show, depending on repetition time and paradigm
               design, slice-timing effects can significantly impair fMRI
               results and slice-timing correction methods can successfully
               compensate for these effects and therefore increase the
               robustness of the data analysis. In addition, our results from
               simulated data were supported by empirical in vivo datasets. Our
               findings suggest that slice-timing correction should be included
               in the fMRI pre-processing pipeline.",

  author    = "Jenkinson, M and Smith, S",
  abstract  = "Registration is an important component of medical image analysis
               and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have
               fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic
               registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all
               share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost
               function. To date little attention has been focused on the
               optimisation method itself, even though the success of most
               registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation.
               This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of
               registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity
               measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation
               methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is
               not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address
               this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is
               specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full
               discussion of all the necessary implementation details is
               included as this is an important part of any practical method.
               Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal,
               inter-subject registration experiments that show that the
               proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum
               than several of the currently available registration packages in
               common usage.",

  abstract  = "Linear registration and motion correction are important
               components of structural and functional brain image analysis.
               Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function
               to determine the best registration. To date, little attention
               has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though
               the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality
               of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization
               process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used
               multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get
               trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches
               are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a
               novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new
               optimization method is specifically designed for registering
               whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of
               producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima.
               The increased robustness of the method, compared to other
               commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In
               addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a
               series of experiments with motion correction. These motion
               correction experiments also investigate how the results are
               affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.",

               the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation

               intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite
               mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
               probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
               Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently
               implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in
               the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a
               minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and
               implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance
               on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the

               evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means

               group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial
               prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also
               evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a
               69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas
               from University College London. These evaluation studies,
               combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos

              commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is
              approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software

              registration, segmentation and template building tools for
              quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to
              quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on
              the affine and deformable components of a template-based
              normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three
              similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and
              faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We
              then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance
              on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain
              image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
              evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both
              the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results
              indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing
              brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling
              approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with
              cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical
              labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our
              two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of
              templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data
              and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for
              this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a
              consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible

  title    = "{Segmentation of brain MR images through a hidden Markov random
              field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm}",
  author   = "Zhang, Y and Brady, M and Smith, S",
  abstract = "The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
              statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
              because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise
              constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a
              histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no
              spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM
              model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of
              noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to
              artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field
              distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
              produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
              hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic
              process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be
              observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through
              observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model
              is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the
              HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information
              is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites.
              Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation
              by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using
              MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the
              HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by
              incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a
              HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be
              achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be
              combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the
              bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997)
              can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a
              three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image

              biomarkers are limited by the ability to reliably characterize
              inter-individual differences in human brain function. Although a
              growing number of connectomics-based measures are reported to
              have moderate to high test-retest reliability, the variability in
              data acquisition, experimental designs, and analytic methods
              precludes the ability to generalize results. The Consortium for

              standard for methods development in functional connectomics.
              Specifically, CoRR has aggregated 1,629 typical individuals'
              resting state fMRI (rfMRI) data (5,093 rfMRI scans) from 18
              international sites, and is openly sharing them via the

              software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic
              resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of
              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed
              by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
              contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in
              five countries and three continents, which is still growing.",

  abstract = "Preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              involves numerous steps to clean and standardize the data before
              statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc
              preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large
              inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows
              has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing.
              We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses
              the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI
              data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to
              the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring
              high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By
              introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative
              integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep
              robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data
              collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled
              spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing
              tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and
              transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure the
              validity of inference and the interpretability of results.",
